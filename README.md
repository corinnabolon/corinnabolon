### Hi there 👋 I'm Corinna

I'm a Full-Stack software developer and here are my projects! I attended an intensive 13-week Bootcamp at Boise Codeworks in Fall of 2023 and now I am continuing to learn.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on rewriting some of my bootcamp projects in a new framework
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python🐍
- 💬 Ask me anything about life in Japan🇯🇵 I lived in Hokkaido for 17 years.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite musical is "Chess" but only the 1984 version.
- 📫 I'd be happy to connect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinna-bolon-690003297/">on LinkedIn</a>!
