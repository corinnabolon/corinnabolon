### Hi there 👋 I'm Corinna, and welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Full-Stack software developer and here are my projects! I attended an intense 13-week Bootcamp at Boise Codeworks in Fall of 2023 where I learned full-stack web development using JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS, and a whole host of other frameworks and technologies. It gave me so much amazing hands-on experience, but also made me realize how much more there is to learn!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on rewriting some of my bootcamp projects in a new framework
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python🐍
- 💬 Ask me anything about life in Japan🇯🇵 I lived in Hokkaido for years!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite musical is "Chess" but only the 1984 version.
- 📫 I'd be happy to connect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinna-bolon-690003297/">on LinkedIn</a>!
